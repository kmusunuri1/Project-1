# Pandemic Preparedness
A pandemic is an epidemic of an infectious disease or virus that has spread across a large region affecting a substantial number of individuals. 
The most relevant pandemic in recent years is the COVID-19 pandemic that has inflicted turmoil and devaststaion across multiple continents and contiunes to evolve into multiple, more aggressiove strains of the initial virus. This virus evolution is arguably due to a lack of preparedness and lack of outbreak infrasturucture; in our explaratory data analysis project we will investigate the relationship between elements of preparedness: declaration of emergency, vaccination rate, and vaccination accessibility and COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations.
