# Pandemic Preparedness
A pandemic is an epidemic of an infectious disease or virus that has spread across a large region affecting a substantial number of individuals. The most relevant pandemic in recent years is the COVID-19 pandemic that has inflicted turmoil and devastation across multiple continents and continues to evolve into multiple, more aggressive strains of the initial virus. This virus evolution is arguably due to a lack of preparedness and lack of outbreak infrastructure; in our exploratory data analysis project we will investigate the relationship between elements of preparedness: declaration of emergency, vaccination rate, social restrictions, and vaccination accessibility and COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations.

Essentially, we want to answer the question: what factors indicate an adequate level of preparedness to handle a pandemic? 

To answer this question, we need to evaluate four supplemental questions:

How does vaccination administration impact the rate or volume of COVID cases?

How does government response affect the volume of COVID-19 cases? 

How does vaccine accessibility impact the volume of COVID cases? 

How does a populationâ€™s region influence COVID cases?

* Values can be negative, typically indicating a correction or an adjustment in the way they were measured.

** Cumulative count will not always amount to the sum of daily counts, because many authorities make changes to criteria for counting cases, but not always make adjustments to the data. There is also potential missing data. All of that makes the cumulative counts drift away from the sum of all daily counts over time, which is why the cumulative values, if reported, are kept in a separate column.
