"See the Census Bureau web site for a description of FIPS codes.

*The 2013 Rural-urban continuum codes classify metropolitan counties (codes 1 through 3) by size of the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), and nonmetropolitan counties (codes 4 through 9) by degree of urbanization and proximity to metro areas. See the Rural-urban continuum codes for precise definitions of each code.

For 1970 and 1980, the share of adults who are college graduates includes those who completed at four or more years of college regardless of degree earned. In 1990, 2000, and 2016-2020 the share includes those who received a bachelor's or higher degree.

The data for 2016-2020 is a 5-year average from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey.

Data is for adults 25 years of age and older.
